# Fat-Finger-Research-App

Whenever you click a point on a map on your phone, it might overlap with another point, and cause you to click on the wrong thing.
This app is meant to investigate how point density affects click accuracy with different selection methods, such as a regular lift-off tap, a magnifying lens, and a bubble cursor.

It was made in Android Studio, and is meant for Android phones running Android 9.0 or higher (for magnifying lens support).
